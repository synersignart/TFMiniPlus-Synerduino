# TFMiniPlus-Synerduino

Synerduino Lidar implementation for Collision avoidance using the TFmini-S or TFMini Plus
combines  Aux Output and RC input triggering
note: TFMini-S requires a logic converter as Arduino voltage are at 5V and may damage the sensor
Logic converter used are Bi-Direction with the A5 B5 input from the Arduino and A3 B3 for the TFMini-S output
