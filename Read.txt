10 Meter range TFMini Plus or TFMini-S (2023 update distance of Lidar to 10 meters Note: sensitivity or acurracy may Vari )


Inorder for this to work Bluetooth radio must be set to a on Communication serial on any device to baud  57600 
Lidar_Forward  and Lidar_Reverse are servo reverse option
